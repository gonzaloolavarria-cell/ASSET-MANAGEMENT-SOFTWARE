## Frequency Unit Validation Tables

### Calendar Causes (must use calendar units)

| Cause | Required Unit Type |
|-------|-------------------|
| AGE | Calendar (DAYS, WEEKS, MONTHS, YEARS) |
| CONTAMINATION | Calendar |
| CORROSIVE_ENVIRONMENT | Calendar |
| EXPOSURE_TO_ATMOSPHERE | Calendar |
| BIO_ORGANISMS | Calendar |
| CHEMICAL_ATTACK | Calendar |

### Operational Causes (must use operational units)

| Cause | Required Unit Type |
|-------|-------------------|
| USE | Operational (HOURS_RUN, HOURS, OPERATING_HOURS, TONNES, CYCLES) |
| ABRASION | Operational |
| MECHANICAL_OVERLOAD | Operational |
| RUBBING | Operational |
| RELATIVE_MOVEMENT | Operational |
| EXCESSIVE_FLUID_VELOCITY | Operational |
| IMPACT_SHOCK_LOADING | Operational |
| CYCLIC_LOADING | Operational |
| METAL_TO_METAL_CONTACT | Operational |

**Calendar units:** DAYS, WEEKS, MONTHS, YEARS
**Operational units:** HOURS_RUN, HOURS, OPERATING_HOURS, TONNES, CYCLES

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Hidden Safety Failure on Protective Relay

**Inputs:**
- is_hidden = true
- failure_consequence = HIDDEN_SAFETY
- cbm_technically_feasible = false
- cbm_economically_viable = false
- ft_feasible = false
- failure_pattern = E_RANDOM (beta = 1.1)

**Walk:** Hidden -> CBM? No -> FT? ft_feasible=false AND E_RANDOM not age-related = No -> Consequence=HIDDEN_SAFETY -> **REDESIGN**

**Result:** Path=HIDDEN_REDESIGN, Strategy=REDESIGN, Secondary=false

### Example 2: Evident Operational on Conveyor Belt

**Inputs:**
- is_hidden = false
- failure_consequence = EVIDENT_OPERATIONAL
- cbm_technically_feasible = true (vibration monitoring)
- cbm_economically_viable = true (justified by production loss)
- cause = ABRASION, frequency_unit = OPERATING_HOURS

**Walk:** Evident -> Operational -> CBM feasible+viable? YES -> **CONDITION_BASED**
**Frequency:** ABRASION=operational, OPERATING_HOURS=operational. VALID.

**Result:** Path=EVIDENT_OPERATIONAL_CBM, Strategy=CONDITION_BASED, Secondary=true

### Example 3: Evident Environmental with No Options

**Inputs:**
- is_hidden = false
- failure_consequence = EVIDENT_ENVIRONMENTAL
- cbm_technically_feasible = false
- cbm_economically_viable = false
- ft_feasible = true
- failure_pattern = E_RANDOM

**Walk:** Evident -> Environmental -> CBM? No -> FT? ft_feasible=true BUT E_RANDOM not age-related = No -> **REDESIGN** (never RTF!)

**Result:** Path=EVIDENT_ENVIRONMENTAL_REDESIGN, Strategy=REDESIGN, Secondary=false
