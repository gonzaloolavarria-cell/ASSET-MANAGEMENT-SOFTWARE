## The 72 Failure Modes

### ARCS (1 combination: FM-01)

General character: Electrical discharge through failed insulation. Calendar-based. Pattern B. Primary CBM: insulation resistance, partial discharge monitoring.

---

#### FM-01 | Arcs + Breakdown in insulation | Cal | B | ISO 4.1/4.5

> **Degradation**: Insulation aging follows Arrhenius relationship — every 10°C above rated temperature halves life; partial discharges create self-accelerating erosion until arc flash >5,000°C. At OCP, high ambient near dryers (>45°C), phosphate dust, and coastal humidity at Jorf Lasfar/Safi accelerate HV motor insulation degradation.

- **Weibull**: β 2.5–3.5, η 15,000–25,000 h
- **Top P-conditions**: Declining insulation resistance (>10%/yr), PD activity >100 pC, tan delta trending >0.5% above baseline
- **Equipment**: Electric motors (EM), power transformers (PT), switchgear (SG), generators (EG), VFDs (FC), power cables (PC) — SAG/ball mill drives, substation transformers
- **Primary CBM**: Insulation resistance testing (megger) | P-F 6–12 mo | IEEE 43, IEC 60085
- **Strategy**: CB preferred (measure insulation resistance on motor winding). FT: replace cable terminations per insulation class thermal life (Class F: 20 yr, derate 50% if >40°C). RTF: only redundant non-critical supplies.
- **Key threshold**: IR <50 MΩ → schedule rewinding within 30 days; IR <1 MΩ/kV → do not energize

---

General character: Progressive or sudden flow obstruction. Mixed patterns (C, E, D). Primary CBM: differential pressure monitoring, flow rate trending.

---

#### FM-02 | Blocks + Contamination | Cal | C | ISO 5.1

> **Degradation**: Foreign particles, scale, biological growth progressively accumulate on internal surfaces, reducing effective flow cross-section until functional failure. At OCP, gypsum scale in phosphoric acid exchangers, phosphate clay deposits, and marine biofouling in seawater cooling at Jorf Lasfar/Safi are primary contaminants.

- **Weibull**: β 2.0–3.0, η 1,000–5,000 h
- **Top P-conditions**: Increasing ΔP (>50% above clean baseline), decreasing flow rate (>10% below design), heat exchanger approach temperature rising
- **Equipment**: Filters/strainers (FS), valves (VA), pumps (PU), heat exchangers (HE), piping (PI), instruments (ID), cooling systems (CS) — slurry filters, seawater coolers
- **Primary CBM**: Differential pressure measurement | P-F 1–4 wk | OEM max ΔP spec

---

#### FM-03 | Blocks + Excessive particle size | Op | E | ISO 5.1

- **Primary CBM**: ΔP monitoring with alarm | P-F minutes–hours | OEM max ΔP spec
- **Strategy**: CB preferred (monitor ΔP on suction strainer — alarm-driven). FT: inspect screen panels at every shutdown (weekly vibrating, monthly trommel). RTF: acceptable for duplex strainers with auto-switchover.
- **Key threshold**: Sudden ΔP >100% of baseline → clear blockage at next safe opportunity; >2 events/month → investigate upstream screening

---

#### FM-04 | Blocks + Insufficient fluid velocity | Op | D | ISO 5.1

> **Degradation**: Flow velocity below critical deposition velocity (Vc) allows suspended solids to settle, forming a stationary bed that progressively reduces cross-section in a positive feedback loop toward complete blockage.

- **Key threshold**: Velocity <1.0×Vc for >30 min → initiate water flush; complete blockage → do NOT increase pump pressure (rupture risk)

---

---

#### FM-06 | Breaks/Fracture/Separates + Mechanical overload | Op | E | ISO 2.5

- **Primary CBM**: UT thickness at corroded/worn sections | P-F 3–12 mo | API 574, ASME B31.3
- **Strategy**: CB preferred (inspect structural condition of crusher frame). FT: replace toggle plates at every major shutdown; belt splices every 12–24 mo. RTF: acceptable for designed sacrificial elements (toggle plates, shear pins).
- **Key threshold**: Section loss >30% → de-rate and plan replacement; visible plastic deformation → reduce load, repair within 30 days

---

#### FM-07 | Breaks/Fracture/Separates + Thermal overload | Op | E | ISO 2.5

> **Degradation**: Thermal shock fracture (rapid ΔT exceeds material fracture strength) or high-temperature embrittlement (>425°C causes graphitization in carbon steel, sigma phase in stainless). At OCP, occurs in kiln/dryer refractory failure exposing shell to >800°C, cast iron pump casings during water quench, and heat exchanger tubes during blockage.

- **Key threshold**: Shell temp >350°C (carbon steel) → reduce firing, plan refractory repair; >400°C or cherry-red → reduce firing immediately, emergency repair

---

#### FM-08 | Corrodes + Bio-organisms | Cal | B | ISO 2.2

> **Degradation**: Microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) occurs when sulfate-reducing, iron-oxidizing, and acid-producing bacteria colonize metal surfaces, forming biofilms that create localized acidic, oxygen-depleted micro-environments driving pitting at 1–5 mm/yr. At OCP, cooling water systems at Jorf Lasfar (seawater circuits), stagnant fire water dead legs, and buried piping in nutrient-rich soil near fertilizer plants are prime MIC habitats.

- **Key threshold**: Planktonic >10⁴ CFU/mL → review biocide program; sessile >10⁵ CFU/cm² → mechanical cleaning required

---

#### FM-09 | Corrodes + Chemical attack | Cal | B | ISO 2.2

> **Degradation**: Direct chemical dissolution where process chemicals react with equipment material, causing progressive mass loss following Arrhenius kinetics — rate doubles per 10°C increase. At OCP, phosphoric acid (28–54% H₃PO₄) attacks carbon steel at 2–10 mm/yr, sulfuric acid is aggressive to most metals, and HF from fluorapatite dissolution attacks glass and refractories at Jorf Lasfar/Safi.

---

#### FM-12 | Corrodes + Dissimilar metals | Cal | B | ISO 2.2

> **Degradation**: Galvanic corrosion when two metals with different electrochemical potentials are electrically connected in an electrolyte — the more active (anodic) metal corrodes preferentially; severity depends on potential difference, electrolyte conductivity, and cathode-to-anode area ratio.

---

#### FM-14 | Corrodes + High-temp corrosive environment | Cal | B | ISO 2.2

> **Degradation**: High-temperature corrosion above 200°C (CS)/400°C (SS) through sulfidation (H₂S/SO₂ forming sulfides 10–100× faster than oxides), hot corrosion (molten Na₂SO₄+V₂O₅ fluxing Cr₂O₃ at 600–900°C), and chloride-accelerated active oxidation. At OCP, rotary kilns for phosphate calcination (800–1000°C), dryers at 300–600°C, and waste heat recovery at Jorf Lasfar sulfuric acid plants are primary zones.

---

#### FM-15 | Corrodes + High-temp environment | Cal | B | ISO 2.2

> **Degradation**: High-temperature oxidation (scaling/dry corrosion) via solid-state diffusion forming oxide scales following parabolic kinetics; scale protectiveness depends on chromium content — carbon steel limited to ~540°C, 304 SS to ~870°C; thermal cycling accelerates by spalling protective scale. At OCP, kiln/dryer shell exterior surfaces, boiler steam-side magnetite growth (>350°C exfoliating), and high-temperature bolt oxidation are key concerns.

#### FM-17 | Corrodes + Poor electrical connections | Cal | C | ISO 2.2

> **Degradation**: Poor contact concentrates current through reduced cross-section, generating I²R resistive heating that drives oxidation, which further reduces contact area — a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop toward thermal runaway. At OCP, phosphate dust contaminates connections, coastal salt air accelerates oxidation, and widespread aluminum-to-copper terminations create vulnerable dissimilar metal joints.

---

#### FM-43 | Immobilised + Contamination | Cal | C | ISO 1.6

---

#### FM-47 | Looses preload + Vibration | Op | B | ISO 1.5

---

#### FM-51 | Overheats/melts + Lack of lubrication | Op | B | ISO 2.7

General character: Motor/conductor thermal damage from excess current. Operational. Pattern E. Primary CBM: motor current monitoring, phase balance.

---

#### FM-60 | Thermally overloads + Mechanical overload | Op | E | ISO 2.7

> **Degradation**: Mechanical loads >design force motors to draw excess current, generating I²R heating that degrades insulation per Arrhenius; a motor at 120% load generates ~44% more heat. At OCP, SAG/ball mill motors overload during hard rock feed, crusher motors from tramp material, slurry pumps from density >1.6 SG, and conveyors from surge loading.

- **Weibull**: β 0.8–1.2, η highly variable
- **Top P-conditions**: Motor current trending >100% FLA, winding temperature exceeding thermal class (RTD), repeated overload trips (>2/month)
- **Equipment**: Motors (EM), pumps (PU), compressors (CO), conveyors (CV), crushers (CU), fans (FA) — SAG/ball mill drives, crusher drives, slurry pump drives
- **Primary CBM**: Motor current monitoring | P-F continuous–weekly | NEMA MG-1, IEC 60034-1
- **Strategy**: CB preferred (monitor motor current). FT: test thermal protection annually per NETA MTS. RTF: only small (<5 kW) non-critical individually protected motors.
- **Key threshold**: Current 110–125% FLA → reduce load immediately; do NOT increase relay setting on repeated trips — investigate root cause

---

#### FM-61 | Thermally overloads + Overcurrent | Op | E | ISO 2.7

> **Degradation**: Electrical overcurrent from phase imbalance, single-phasing, voltage depression, or harmonic distortion; negative-sequence current heats rotor bars at ~6× the rate of positive-sequence. At OCP, MV overhead lines at Khouribga cause phase loss, VFD-driven pumps produce 25–40% THD-I, and legacy undersized cables at pre-1990 sites exceed ampacity.

- **Weibull**: β 0.8–1.2, η highly variable
- **Top P-conditions**: Phase current imbalance >5%, voltage imbalance >2% at PCC, cable/neutral temperature elevated (thermography)
- **Equipment**: Motors (EM), transformers (PT), cables (PC), switchgear (SG), VFDs (FC), capacitor banks (CB), UPS (UP) — mill drives, VFD-fed pumps, distribution transformers
- **Primary CBM**: Phase current and voltage balance monitoring | P-F continuous–weekly | NEMA MG-1, IEC 60034-26
- **Strategy**: CB preferred (measure phase balance). FT: verify relay settings every 3 yr per NETA MTS; power quality survey annually per IEEE 519. RTF: only small individually protected motors.
- **Key threshold**: Voltage imbalance >3% or single phase → trip immediately (rotor destroyed in 2–10 min); THD-I >15% → install output reactor/sine-wave filter

### WASHES OFF (2 combinations: FM-62 to FM-63)

General character: Progressive removal of protective coatings/layers by fluid or use. Mixed basis. Patterns: C (velocity-driven), B (use-driven). Primary CBM: UT thickness, coating DFT measurement.

---

#### FM-62 | Washes off + Excessive fluid velocity | Op | C | ISO 2.3

> **Degradation**: Fluid kinetic energy exceeding coating adhesion progressively removes protective linings via hydrodynamic shear and particle-assisted erosion; wall shear scales with velocity² so doubling velocity quadruples erosive force. At OCP, rubber-lined slurry pipes at Khouribga lose linings at elbows at 2–5 m/s, pump volute linings erode at the tongue, and PTFE linings in acid piping at Jorf Lasfar fail from gypsum-laden flow.

- **Weibull**: β 1.5–3.0, η 5,000–20,000 h
- **Top P-conditions**: UT wall thickness loss >10% from baseline, visible lining bare spots during internal inspection, downstream coating particles in fluid
- **Equipment**: Piping (PI), pumps (PU), valves (VA), heat exchangers (HE), filters (FS), pressure vessels (VE) — rubber-lined slurry pipelines, PTFE-lined acid piping, slurry pump volutes
- **Primary CBM**: UT thickness at high-velocity points | P-F 1–6 mo | ASME B31.3, API 570/574
- **Strategy**: CB preferred (measure wall thickness on elbow). FT: replace rubber lining — elbows 12–18 mo, straight 24–36 mo, pump volutes 6–12 mo. RTF: only non-pressure atmospheric components.
- **Key threshold**: Wall <120% design minimum → schedule replacement within 30 days; at or below minimum → remove immediately per API 574

---

#### FM-63 | Washes off + Use | Op | B | ISO 2.3

> **Degradation**: Normal operational exposure progressively depletes protective coatings at predictable rates through mild fluid abrasion, chemical dissolution, and weathering; depletion scales linearly with time or throughput. At OCP, marine atmosphere at Jorf Lasfar/Safi consumes paint 30–40% faster than inland; rubber linings, anti-corrosion coatings, and chrome pump shaft sleeves thin with cumulative hours.

- **Weibull**: β 2.0–4.0, η 5,000–30,000 h
- **Top P-conditions**: Coating DFT <70% of original, visual chalking/blistering/rust bleeding (ASTM D610/D714), corrosion rate increase on protected surfaces
- **Equipment**: Piping (PI), storage tanks (TA), heat exchangers (HE), pressure vessels (VE), pumps (PU), conveyors (CV), cranes (CR) — structural steel, cooling water piping, pump shaft sleeves
- **Primary CBM**: Coating thickness measurement (DFT gauge) | P-F 3–12 mo | SSPC-PA 2, ISO 19840
- **Strategy**: CB preferred for high-value coatings. FT: scheduled restoration — repaint marine 5–7 yr, inland 7–10 yr; rubber linings 3–5 yr in slurry. RTF: only aesthetic coatings on non-structural indoor equipment.
- **Key threshold**: DFT <50% minimum or rust Ri 4 (>8%) → full restoration within 30 days; base metal exposed >10% → immediate spot-prime

---

### WEARS (9 combinations: FM-64 to FM-72)

General character: Progressive material removal from mechanical contact, fluid erosion, or lubrication failure. All Operational. Patterns: B (progressive), E (event-driven), C (contamination). Primary CBM: oil analysis, UT thickness, vibration, dimensional measurement.

---

#### FM-64 | Wears + Breakdown of lubrication | Op | B | ISO 2.4

> **Degradation**: Lubricant properties degrade through oxidation, thermal cracking, additive depletion, and water contamination until specific film thickness drops below 1.0, transitioning from mild oxidative wear (~1 μm/1000 h) to severe adhesive wear (~10–100 μm/1000 h). At OCP, high gearbox temps (70–90°C), phosphate dust ingress, and extended intervals on hard-to-stop equipment accelerate breakdown.

- **Weibull**: β 2.0–3.5, η 5,000–25,000 h
- **Top P-conditions**: Oil TAN >2.0 mg KOH/g, viscosity change >20%, wear metals (Fe, Cu, Sn) increasing
- **Equipment**: Gearboxes (GB), pumps (PU), compressors (CO), motors (EM), conveyors (CV), crushers (CU), engines (EN) — mill gearboxes, crusher gearboxes, large motor bearings
- **Primary CBM**: Oil analysis (oxidation, viscosity, TAN, wear metals) | P-F 1–3 mo | ASTM D974/D445/E2412, ISO 4406
- **Strategy**: CB preferred (analyze lubricant on gearbox). FT: oil change — mineral 4,000–8,000 h, synthetic 8,000–16,000 h; reduce 30% if >80°C. RTF: only sealed-for-life non-critical small bearings.
- **Key threshold**: TAN >4.0 mg KOH/g or wear metals step-change → change oil immediately AND investigate wear source

---

#### FM-65 | Wears + Entrained air (cavitation) | Op | E | ISO 2.4

> **Degradation**: Air/vapor bubbles implode near surfaces generating micro-jets at >1 GPa and >5,000°C, progressively removing material at 0.1–10 mm/yr with characteristic spongy pitting at impeller tips, vortex cores, and downstream of restrictions. At OCP, slurry pump impellers at Khouribga cavitate with marginal NPSH; control valves at Jorf Lasfar flash in hot acid; cyclone feed pumps entrain air.

- **Weibull**: β 0.8–1.2, η highly variable
- **Top P-conditions**: Distinctive crackling cavitation noise, pump head/efficiency decreasing, broadband HF vibration (>5 kHz)
- **Equipment**: Pumps (PU), valves (VA), piping (PI), hydraulic systems (HY), hydrocyclones (HC) — slurry pumps, cooling water pumps, control valves, classification cyclones
- **Primary CBM**: Vibration monitoring (broadband HF cavitation) | P-F 1–4 wk | ISO 10816, ISO 13709
- **Strategy**: CB preferred (monitor NPSH and vibration on pump). FT: inspect impeller at overhaul — cast iron 2,000–5,000 h, high-chrome 5,000–12,000 h, duplex 10,000–25,000 h. RTF: only non-critical small pumps.
- **Key threshold**: NPSHa < NPSHr × 1.3 → correct suction deficiency immediately; cavitation depth >2 mm → replace and upgrade material

---

#### FM-66 | Wears + Excessive fluid velocity | Op | B | ISO 2.4

> **Degradation**: Suspended particles at high velocity impact surfaces causing erosion following power-law (rate ∝ velocity²·⁰⁻⁴·⁰); doubling velocity increases erosion 4–16×. At OCP, slurry pipeline elbows on Khouribga–Jorf line erode at up to 4 m/s, pump cut-water sees 2–3× average velocity, hydrocyclone apexes experience maximum vortex velocity, and reactor jet nozzles suffer concentrated erosion.

- **Weibull**: β 2.0–4.0, η 3,000–20,000 h
- **Top P-conditions**: UT wall thinning at elbows/tees, erosion rate above design allowance, characteristic horseshoe/cat-eye patterns
- **Equipment**: Piping (PI), pumps (PU), valves (VA), hydrocyclones (HC), heat exchangers (HE), nozzles (NO) — Khouribga-Jorf slurry pipeline, slurry pump impellers, classification cyclones
- **Primary CBM**: UT wall thickness at erosion-prone locations | P-F 1–6 mo | API 574, ASME B31.3
- **Strategy**: CB preferred (measure wall thickness on pipeline elbow). FT: replace pump impeller 3,000–10,000 h; elbows 12–36 mo; cyclone apex 1,000–5,000 h. RTF: only non-pressurized gravity chute liners.
- **Key threshold**: Wall 100–120% of minimum → plan replacement within 30 days; at/below minimum → remove immediately

---

#### FM-67 | Wears + Impact/shock loading | Op | B | ISO 2.4

> **Degradation**: Repeated high-energy impacts cause progressive removal through surface fatigue, spalling, and plastic deformation; austenitic Mn steel work-hardens (200→500 HB) but material is still consumed. At OCP, crusher liners at 5–15 m/s, vibrating screen panels at Khouribga, mill liners from cascading charge, and conveyor loading zones from falling material.

- **Weibull**: β 1.5–3.0, η 3,000–15,000 h
- **Top P-conditions**: Progressive thickness reduction at impact zones, crusher liner profile worn beyond OEM minimum, screen apertures worn >110% nominal
- **Equipment**: Crushers (CU), mills (ML), screens (SC), conveyors (CV), feeders (FE), chutes (PI) — jaw/cone/impact crushers, SAG/ball mills, vibrating screens, conveyor loading zones
- **Primary CBM**: Liner thickness/profile measurement (template, UT) | P-F monthly–quarterly | OEM specification
- **Strategy**: CB preferred (measure liner thickness on crusher). FT: jaw plates 500–2,000 h, cone mantle 1,500–4,000 h, blow bars 200–800 h, mill liners 6,000–18,000 h. RTF: acceptable for sacrificial components (chute liners, screen panels, impact idler rings).
- **Key threshold**: Crusher liner at/below OEM minimum → replace within 7 days (risk of frame damage)

---

#### FM-68 | Wears + Low pressure | Op | E | ISO 2.4

> **Degradation**: Insufficient pressure at critical locations allows cavitation, flashing, or loss of hydrodynamic bearing film, all causing accelerated material removal. At OCP, slurry pump suction in deep Khouribga sumps with SG 1.3–1.6 approaches cavitation limits, acid control valves at 80–110°C flash near vapor pressure, and mill lube oil loses film from filter blockage.

- **Weibull**: β 0.8–1.2, η highly variable
- **Top P-conditions**: Suction pressure below design minimum (approaching NPSHr), cavitation noise at pump, oil supply pressure below OEM minimum at bearing
- **Equipment**: Pumps (PU), valves (VA), bearings (BE), compressors (CO), piping (PI), hydraulic systems (HY) — deep sump slurry pumps, high-ΔP control valves, mill trunnion bearings
- **Primary CBM**: Suction pressure monitoring | P-F continuous | ISO 13709, HI 9.6.1
- **Strategy**: CB preferred (monitor suction pressure). FT: clean suction strainer every 3 mo in slurry; NPSH verification at every process change. RTF: only non-critical small pumps.
- **Key threshold**: NPSHa < NPSHr × 1.3 → correct immediately; bearing oil below OEM minimum → trip before damage

---

#### FM-69 | Wears + Lubricant contamination (particles) | Cal | C | ISO 2.4

> **Degradation**: Hard particles (1–25 μm) circulating in lubricant bridge the oil film causing three-body abrasive wear; process is autocatalytic as wear debris generates secondary particles. At OCP, phosphate dust ingresses through seals, slurry leaks through failed mechanical seals, and improper oil handling introduces contamination — a bearing at ISO 21/19/16 has only 20% of life at 15/13/10.

- **Weibull**: β 1.5–2.5, η 5,000–30,000 h
- **Top P-conditions**: ISO 4406 count exceeding target by ≥2 codes, wear metals trending upward, ferrography showing cutting wear (long ribbon particles)
- **Equipment**: Gearboxes (GB), pumps (PU), hydraulic systems (HY), compressors (CO), motors (EM), engines (EN), conveyors (CV) — mill gearboxes, hydraulic servo valves, mobile equipment
- **Primary CBM**: Oil particle count (ISO 4406) | P-F 1–3 mo | ISO 4406/4407
- **Strategy**: CB preferred (analyze particle count on gearbox oil). FT: replace filters per ΔP or OEM (1,000–3,000 h); desiccant breathers every 3–6 mo in dusty OCP. RTF: never for servo valves or precision gears.
- **Key threshold**: Count exceeding target by >4 ISO codes → flush, replace oil, inspect seals, install kidney-loop filtration

---

#### FM-70 | Wears + Mechanical overload | Op | E | ISO 2.4

> **Degradation**: Loads exceeding design squeeze lubricant film thinner (thickness ∝ load⁻⁰·⁷³ per EHL), causing asperity contact and transition from mild to severe wear with as little as 25% overload. At OCP, crusher liners wear faster in harder rock zones (WI 10–18 kWh/t), pump wear rings open rapidly at densities above design, and gearbox teeth pit above rated torque.

- **Weibull**: β 0.8–1.5, η highly variable
- **Top P-conditions**: Wear rate increasing above trend, operating load sustained above design, oil analysis wear metals correlated with load events
- **Equipment**: Crushers (CU), pumps (PU), gearboxes (GB), mills (ML), conveyors (CV), compressors (CO), valves (VA) — crusher liners, pump wear rings, mill gearboxes
- **Primary CBM**: Load monitoring (power, current, pressure) | P-F continuous | Equipment design spec
- **Strategy**: CB preferred (monitor operating load). FT: verify overload protection annually; torque limiter test at each shutdown. RTF: only sacrificial parts (shear pins, screen panels).
- **Key threshold**: Load consistently >100% design → investigate and reduce; wear rate >150% historical → adjust maintenance interval

---

#### FM-71 | Wears + Metal to metal contact | Op | B | ISO 2.4

> **Degradation**: Direct metallic surface contact without lubricant film causes micro-welding at asperity junctions; continued motion fractures welds, transferring material per Archard's equation, progressing through running-in, steady-state, and severe wear. At OCP, pump shaft sleeves at packing/seal zones, wire ropes on sheaves, chain pins on bushings, valve stems at packing contact.

- **Weibull**: β 2.0–3.5, η 5,000–30,000 h
- **Top P-conditions**: Increasing shaft sleeve diameter at seal zone (micrometer), wire rope flattened strands and sheave groove wear, chain elongation >2%
- **Equipment**: Pumps (PU), valves (VA), cranes (CR), conveyors (CV), brakes (BR), couplings (CG), gearboxes (GB) — slurry pump shaft sleeves, overhead crane wire rope, chain conveyors
- **Primary CBM**: Dimensional measurement of wear components | P-F 3–12 mo | OEM specification
- **Strategy**: CB preferred (measure shaft sleeve diameter). FT: replace packing at every valve overhaul; shaft sleeves at seal change; wire rope per ISO 4309. RTF: acceptable for sacrificial elements (brake pads, packing, chain links).
- **Key threshold**: Wire rope approaching ISO 4309 discard → replace within 30 days; brake disc below OEM minimum → replace immediately (safety)

---

#### FM-72 | Wears + Relative movement (fretting) | Op | B | ISO 2.4

> **Degradation**: Small-amplitude oscillatory motion (5–300 μm) between clamped surfaces breaks oxide films, generating hard Fe₂O₃ debris as abrasive third body with wear coefficient 10–100× higher than sliding wear; fretting also initiates fatigue cracks. At OCP, pump shaft bearing seats fret from vibration, coupling hubs loosen, wire ropes suffer internal strand fretting (primary life limiter), and crusher eccentric shaft fits degrade.

- **Weibull**: β 2.0–3.5, η 8,000–40,000 h
- **Top P-conditions**: Red-brown oxide powder (fretting debris) at press-fit interfaces, increasing bearing clearance on shaft (dial indicator), vibration showing progressive looseness
- **Equipment**: Pumps (PU), motors (EM), conveyors (CV), crushers (CU), mills (ML), cranes (CR), couplings (CG), fans (FA) — pump bearing seats, motor rotor fits, wire ropes, mill trunnion seats
- **Primary CBM**: Vibration monitoring for progressive fit loosening | P-F 1–4 wk | ISO 10816, ISO 20816
- **Strategy**: CB preferred (monitor vibration for fit loosening). FT: measure shaft at all fits during every bearing replacement; wire rope internal inspection per ISO 4309 every 6 mo; apply anti-fretting compound at all press-fits during reassembly. RTF: never for rotating shaft fits or wire ropes.
- **Key threshold**: Shaft undersize at bearing seat → apply shaft repair (metal spray + grind); fretting cracks at shaft shoulder → replace shaft immediately (fatigue risk)
