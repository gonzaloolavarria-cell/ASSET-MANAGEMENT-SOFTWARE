## 1. Overview

This document describes the three SAP PM (Plant Maintenance) upload templates used for creating maintenance plans from strategy output. These templates are designed for mass upload of maintenance items, task lists, and work plans into SAP.

**Source directory:**
```
asset-management-methodology/sap-upload-sheets-template-(MIS-P01-BF01-F740-7310)/
```

The naming convention `MIS-P01-BF01-F740-7310` represents the functional location used in the example data (a Warman Pump 3/2 at a mining site).

## 2. Template Source and Context

| Template File | SAP Transaction | Purpose |
|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| `Maintenance Item.xlsx` | IP04 (linked) | Defines WHAT gets maintained and HOW OFTEN |
| `Task List.xlsx` | IA11 | Defines the OPERATIONS (steps) to perform |
| `Work Plan.xlsx` | IP41 | Defines the SCHEDULING parameters |

**Example Equipment:** 2-Weekly Warman Pump 3/2 Service at Functional Location `MIS-P01-BF01-F740-7310`

## 6. Field Relationships and Data Flow

### Cross-Reference Diagram

```
Work Plan (IP41)                Maintenance Item (IP04)           Task List (IA11)
==================              =======================           ================
Maintenance Plan ---references--> Maintenance Item number
                                  Group --------references------> Task List Group
                                  Counter ------references------> Task List Counter
                                  PlanPlant ----must match-------> Planning Plant
                                  Main Work Center --matches----> Main Work Centre
                                  Functional Location --matches--> Functional Location
```

### Placeholder Cross-Referencing System

The templates use a `$` prefix placeholder system for linking records before upload:

| Placeholder | Used In | Links To |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| `$MI1` | Maintenance Item number (MI template), Maintenance Item (WP template) | Links Work Plan to its Maintenance Item |
| `$TL1` | Group (MI template), Task List Group (TL template) | Links Maintenance Item to its Task List |

For multiple items in a single upload, increment the number: `$MI1`, `$MI2`, `$MI3`, etc.

---

## 7. Validation Rules and Constraints

### Mandatory Field Combinations

1. **Functional Location OR Equipment** must be provided in the Maintenance Item (at least one).
2. **Task List Group + Counter** must be unique per task list.
3. **Operation Number** must be unique within a task list (Group + Counter combination).
4. **Maintenance Plan** identifier must be unique across the SAP system.

### Data Type Constraints

| Field Type | Constraint |
|-----------|------------|
| Short Text fields | Max 40 characters |
| Plant codes | 4-character alphanumeric |
| Work Center codes | Alphanumeric, plant-specific |
| Numeric fields (Cycle, Duration) | Positive numbers |
| Percentage fields | 0-100 |
| Unit fields | Must match SAP unit of measure catalog |

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Description length:** SAP truncates at 40 characters for short text fields.
2. **Work center plant mismatch:** The Work Centre Plant must be a valid plant in SAP where the work center exists.
3. **Missing cross-references:** The `$MI[n]` and `$TL[n]` placeholders must resolve to valid records before upload.
4. **Control key selection:** Using `PMIN` (inspection) vs `PM01` (internal) affects scheduling and confirmation behavior.
5. **Cycle unit consistency:** The Cycle value and Cycle Unit must be logically consistent (e.g., 14 DAY = 2 WEEKLY).

## 8. Example Data Walkthrough

### Scenario: 2-Weekly Warman Pump 3/2 Service

**Functional Location:** `MIS-P01-BF01-F740-7310`
**Frequency:** Every 14 days (2 weekly)
**Order Type:** PM03 (Preventive condition-based)

| 10 | S32A2ME | Auto Electrician | 3 hours | 2 weekly Pump Service Auto Electrician |
| 20 | S32A1MF | Fitter | 3 hours | 2 weekly Pump Service Fitter |

- Task List Group: `$TL1`, Counter: `1`
- Status: `4` (Released)
- System condition: `3` (Not in operation / Offline)
- Control key: `PMIN` (Inspection)

#### Step 2: Maintenance Item (links task list to equipment)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| MI Number | `$MI1` |
| Description | 2W Warman Pump 3/2 Service |
| Order Type | PM03 |
| Plant | K210 |
| Priority | HIGH-7 DAYS |
| Work Center | S32A1 |
| Planner Group | 41 |
| Functional Location | MIS-P01-BF01-F740-7310 |
| Task List Group | `$TL1` |
| Task List Type | T |

#### Step 3: Work Plan (defines scheduling)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Plan ID | F740-7310-2W |
| Category | PM |
| Description | 2W Warman Pump 3/2 Service |
| Cycle | 14 DAY |
| Cycle Text | 2 WEEKLY |
| Cycle Mod Factor | 1 |
| Scheduling Period | 30 DAY |
| Call Horizon | 50% |
| Sort Field | TIME BASED PREVENTIVE |
| Maintenance Item | `$MI1` |

#### Naming Convention for Plan ID

Format: `[FuncLoc-Suffix]-[Frequency]`
- `F740-7310` = Last portion of functional location
- `2W` = 2 Weekly

Other common frequency codes:
- `1D` = Daily
- `1W` = Weekly
- `2W` = 2 Weekly (Fortnightly)
- `4W` = 4 Weekly (Monthly)
- `13W` = 13 Weekly (Quarterly)
- `26W` = 26 Weekly (Semi-Annual)
- `52W` = 52 Weekly (Annual)
- `500H` = 500 Hours
- `1000H` = 1000 Hours
