## 5. Strategy 4: Komatsu 830E Truck -- Chilean Operation

**Asset:** Komatsu 830E Dump Truck
**Context:** DEV (Development) -- BD Santiago, Chile
**Export Format:** MaintenanceStrategy (different from AssetTactics format)

### Column Structure

This strategy uses a different export format focused on the maintenance strategy structure rather than individual tactics. The data includes:

- Strategy organization by maintainable item
- Task definitions with intervals
- Constraint mappings (Online/Offline)
- Workshop session references
- Bilingual content (Spanish task descriptions where applicable)

### Key Distinction

This template represents a development/draft strategy (`DEV` prefix) being built for a Chilean operation, showing the strategy-building process in action rather than a finalized export.

## 7. Tactics Type Distribution and Usage Guide

### Tactics Types Defined

| Tactics Type | Description | When to Use |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Condition Based** | Inspect/monitor, act only if condition warrants. Primary task is inspection; secondary task is corrective action. | When failure is detectable before functional loss. Most common type. |
| **Fixed Time** | Replace/overhaul at fixed intervals regardless of condition. | When failure mode is age-related and not reliably detectable, or when the cost of inspection exceeds replacement. |
| **Run Until Failure** | No proactive maintenance. Replace on failure. Only secondary task defined. | When failure has no safety consequence, no production impact, and the cost of prevention exceeds failure cost. Primary Task Interval = 0. |
| **Redesign** | Recommend a design change to eliminate the failure mode. | When no maintenance task can effectively manage the failure mode. |

### Typical Distribution

Based on the analyzed strategies:

| Tactics Type | Approximate % | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Condition Based | 60-70% | Dominant approach for most components |
| Fixed Time | 15-25% | Cleaning, scheduled replacements |
| Run Until Failure | 10-15% | Low-consequence failures |
| Redesign | <5% | Design improvement recommendations |
